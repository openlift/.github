# Introducing OpenLift – The Open Source Fitness Tracker (Coming 2025)

<!--truncate-->

We’re excited to introduce **[OpenLift](https://openlift.app)** – an open-source fitness tracker built for mobile from the ground up.

Whether you're lifting heavy, chasing endurance gains, or just starting out — OpenLift is being designed as your go-to fitness companion, with a modern mobile experience that puts you in control.

## Mobile-Only by Design

OpenLift is being developed as a mobile-first, mobile-only application. No web frontend, no distractions — just one streamlined mobile app with all the features you need.

Our backend, built with Fastify and PostgreSQL, ensures performance, flexibility, and self-hosting options for privacy-conscious users.

## Why OpenLift?

OpenLift is different from traditional fitness apps — here's why:

- 100% open source: Your app, your data, your rules.
- No subscriptions: It’ll be completely free — now and forever.
- Self-hosting available: Want full control? Host your own OpenLift backend and own your data.
- No shady analytics or tracking: We’re building this for fitness, not for harvesting your information.

## Coming in 2025

OpenLift is still in development — but we're making rapid progress.

We’re planning to release in 2025, and when we do, you’ll get:
- A single, thoughtfully designed mobile app.
- Smart workout tracking (weights, reps, RPE, notes).
- Local-first privacy with optional self-hosting.
- Optional photo uploads for progress and form tracking.
- Insightful analytics to help you grow stronger, smarter, and faster.

OpenLift isn’t just another fitness app — it’s a movement.

A mobile experience for everyone, whether you're lifting at home, training in a gym, or logging sessions out in the wild. Built for the community, by the community — and always on your terms.

Stay tuned. 2025 is going to be big.
