# Hey There â€“ We're Building Something Cool (And Open Source)

<!--truncate-->

We're the new kids on the block in the fitness app world, and honestly? We're pretty excited about what we're building.

Meet **[OpenLift](https://openlift.app)** â€“ a simple, open-source fitness tracker that we're creating from scratch. No fancy VC funding, no Silicon Valley buzzwords â€“ just a small team trying to build something we'd actually want to use.

## What We're Up To

We're building OpenLift as a mobile-only fitness app. Why mobile-only? Because that's where we actually log our workouts â€“ between sets, in the gym, when we remember we forgot to track that last set.

Our backend runs on Fastify and MongoDB (yeah, we know, everyone's got opinions about databases), and we're designing everything to be self-hostable if that's your thing.

## Why We Started This

Look, there are tons of fitness apps out there. But here's what bugged us about most of them:

- They want your data, your money, and sometimes both
- Half the features are locked behind paywalls
- You never really own your workout history
- Privacy policies that would make a lawyer cry

So we thought, "What if we just... didn't do any of that?"

## We're Still Building

Full transparency: we're not done yet. We're aiming for 2025, and we're working on it nights and weekends.

When we do launch, you'll get:
- A straightforward mobile app for tracking workouts
- Support for weights, reps, RPE, and notes (the stuff that actually matters)
- Your data stays yours, period
- Optional photo uploads for progress tracking
- Simple analytics to help you see how you're doing

The core stuff will always be free if you self-host. Advanced features (we're talking about things like detailed analytics, cloud backup, or premium integrations) will be closed-source and cost a little â€“ just enough to cover hosting, storage, and make this thing self-sustainable.

## Just Another Fitness App?

Maybe. But it's our fitness app, and we're building it the way we think it should be built.

No venture capital breathing down our necks, no growth hackers trying to maximize engagement, no dark patterns to keep you hooked. Just a simple tool for people who want to track their workouts without all the extra stuff.

We'll see you in 2025. ðŸ’ª
